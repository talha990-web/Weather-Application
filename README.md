A weather app is a mobile or web application designed to provide users with current and forecasted weather information based on their location or a specified area. Weather apps use data from weather services and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather-related details.

Key Features of a Weather App:
Current Weather:

Displays the current temperature, weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.), humidity, wind speed, and pressure for a user-specified location.

Weather Forecast:

Provides weather predictions for the upcoming hours, days, or even weeks. This can include high/low temperatures, chances of precipitation, wind speeds, and more.

Location-Based Services:

Uses GPS to determine the user's current location and automatically provides weather details for that location.

Weather Maps:

Shows radar images or satellite views of weather patterns, such as cloud cover, storms, or rainfall.

Alerts and Notifications:

Sends users push notifications or alerts for severe weather conditions, like thunderstorms, heavy rain, or snow.

Interactive User Interface:

Many apps offer an easy-to-navigate interface with graphs, icons, and maps, making it simple to understand weather conditions.

Customizable Features:

Users may be able to customize the app by selecting multiple locations, setting favorite locations, or adjusting settings to display only certain types of weather information.
